My main focus to create this project was:

- Code simplicity.
- Nesting -> to keep all components in sub folders with each component with their CSS.
- Since I didn't found a working API for this project I used hardcoded data, however in the App.js (getData function) you can check how the project could retrieve data through an API.
- Reusable components. Such is the case of AddBottle component that serves the purpose of adding a new bottle (either wine or beer) to the "database".
- Clear name functions, so that everybody can have a glimpse of the function purpose.

- No unit tests were implemented nor responsive webapp (CSS media queries) although in this particular project it stays clean and formated even in small devices.
